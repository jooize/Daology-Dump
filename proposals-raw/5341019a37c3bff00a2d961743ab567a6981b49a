The motion with hash 8688c842023109881ad6a77bc8bdfe8f5c1704dc "No Nu Liquidity Without a Revenue Model" shall be null and void with the passage of this motion.

Numerous models for making money and reducing liabilities have already been identified and extensively discussed: trading spreads, transaction fees based on message size, transaction fees based on value transferred, lost private keys resulting in unspendable NuBits, gradual devaluation of liabilities (in step with the US Dollar) and sale of NuShares are among them.
