Nowadays B&C project is in a dangerous status, Jordan Lee as a project leader has disappeared, the development fund also in danger because they are transferred into Nubit with pegging broken. The new technical leader @Sigmike has some disagreement with @Eleven who is recruited by Jordan Lee. Other developers status remains unknown. And the white paper is incomplete.

Therefore a team must be established for BKS holders in order to replace Jordan Lee's role of project management. This group consists of 6 members elected from the eligible signers via independent motions, and they will take charge of project management such as hire/fire developers(reference technical leader's opinion), spend development fund, crowdfunding and communicate with technical persons such as Sigmike and Eleven. 

After this motion passed, Angela and Jordan should hand over the remaining development fund(NBT, BTC etc)to this group with multisignature. When this group makes a decision(4 out of 6), there will be 10 days publicity period for shareholders to veto, if no opposite motion is passed, the decision becomes valid. Generally, their group take charge of daily operation of B&C exchange company. 

After this group established, they will discuss with Sigmike about the road map of B&C project as Sigmike has been elected as B&C's technical leader. Therefore, the two big responsibilities of B&C, technical and management roles are clearly defined. Both RSOT and technical leader can NOT fire each other, both should be elected directly by shareholder via independent motions. In future, the shareholders can pass a motion to modify the member quantity of RSOT, usually the upper limit is 15 persons because of the multisignature mechanism.

RSOT is a permanent organization until B&C shareholders votes to disband it.
