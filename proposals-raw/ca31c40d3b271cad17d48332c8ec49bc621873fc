Dear shareholders,

after a grace period of 45 days my NuBot gateway operation on Poloniex was active for 6 days (including today).
Based on https://discuss.nubits.com/t/passed-motion-to-permit-dual-side-nubot-on-poloniex/3333 this entitles me to raise a daily fee of 15 NBT totaling 90 NBT for the 6 days.
The gateway operation was terminated by FLOT request (https://discuss.nubits.com/t/flot-btc-operations-buy-side/3117/541) and once the withdrawal of the funds is complete, the operation will be converted in unattended standby mode.

The NBT address from this grant might be used for broadcasting liquidity of future operations.
While it's technically not necessary to state that (as each NBT grant address can be used for that), I wanted to include it into this grant.
