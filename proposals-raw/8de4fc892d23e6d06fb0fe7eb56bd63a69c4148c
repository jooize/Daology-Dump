This is draft is quite preliminary and should be regarded as to be an exploration of the items or aspects that should be the subject of peg adjustment regulation.

The objectives of peg adjustment regulation are:

1. Increase the pegged price.
2. Coordinate the change among liquidity so that there is unity about the pegged price at all times.
3. Prevent any losses being imposed on liquidity providers. Consider an increase in a peg of 10%. If this were announced to occur at a specific date in the future, speculators would purchase all NuBits at established price before the official increase, then sell all NuBits back to liquidity providers once the official price was increased. Liquidity providers would lose the 10% increase. This suggests changes need to be small and not planned out too far ahead.
