The Standard and Core motion currently requires to sell NSR to replenish T4 reserve. 

According to the latest calculation 100 million NSR is requested to be granted to FLOT NSR's #3 multisig address to make it easier for members who show up more often to sign.

The grant will be used to replenish reserve and reduce Nu liability.
