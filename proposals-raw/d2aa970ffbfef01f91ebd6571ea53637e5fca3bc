A temporary moratorium on the issuance of NuBits will be observed by shareholders and custodians. This means shareholders should not pass any custodial grants for NuBits. Only custodial grants of NuShares will be acceptable. Existing NuBits in tier 4 held by FLOT, FSRT and Jordan Lee must be held at their current address or burned. Compensation can still be given in NuBits to contractors, but only if NuShares are sold for NuBits purchased on the open market.

This moratorium on the issuance of NuBits will lift when the NuBit price is $1.00 again.
