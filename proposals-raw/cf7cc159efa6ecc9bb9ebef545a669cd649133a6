Making BlockShares modestly liquid by getting them listed on an exchange will make them considerably more attractive as an asset. I propose we do so by offering a reward that can be claimed by any exchange that lists a BKS/BTC pair. The reward will be escalated gradually until it is collected. Only one reward will be given, to the first exchange to list a BlockShares/Bitcoin pair. We will also offer a reward for a successful referral. We need community members to approach exchanges and propose they list BKS and make them aware of the reward we are offering. If an exchange that lists BKS says a particular person made them aware of the opportunity, that person should get 20% of the reward value.

The reward will start at $500 USD and will be capped at $3000 USD. Each week (7 day period after this motion is passed), we will increase the reward by $500 USD until it is paid or until it reaches the maximum value of $3000. This fee will be paid by the custodian of B&C development funds. Currently there is a proposal to make @Phoenix this custodian. 

As 20% of the reward value, the referral bonus will begin at $100 USD and rise to a maximum of $600 USD.

While it would be prudent for an exchange seeking the reward to contact the community (or @Phoenix if he is made custodian of funds) to ensure their planned listing is eligible for the reward before beginning work, they aren't required to seek any agreement in advance. It can be a very small and obscure exchange. To receive the reward, you need to accept deposits of native BlockShares and Bitcoin and permit native withdrawals of the same. Creating a proxy asset for BlockShares for trading on NXT doesn't qualify for the reward, for instance. Payment of the reward will be made once the trading pair is working for one week.
