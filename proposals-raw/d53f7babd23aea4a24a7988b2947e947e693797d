This motion does only one thing technically.  It invalidates motion a2a32c8ef97f7145f05e97e0e7d69ead6a61dc47 should these two motions pass in successtion, thereby reinstating RSOT and requiring the B&C funds to be moved into multisig possession.

Abstractly, this motion makes the statement that motions created by B&C shareholders have the full authority to govern the organization.  It disavows the structure of loyalty referenced by the aforementioned motion and revalidates the shareholder's power to govern B&C development funds via blockchain motions.
