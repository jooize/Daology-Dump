This motions refers to the custodial I've obtained for executing the NuDroid upgrade as detailed in this custodial grant: https://daology.org/u/cybnate/proposals/b90d9bcdbaee28337bc017e605e21f4b40109c9d

Due to the events in the last few weeks which broke the $1 peg with NuBits, the contract can't be executed normally. Given that other urgent matters are at hand to re-establish the peg, I propose that the contract between me and the Shareholders is postponed until the peg is restored.

Therefore the developer, MatthewLM won't deliver the required work according to the agreed timelines. The development work to date has been published. The details are here: https://discuss.nubits.com/t/passed-nudroid-upgrade-v5-april-2016/3716/39

The Shareholders agree that the initial payment of 4,000 NBT is sufficient for the current work.
The NuDroid app will remain on Google Play until at least January 2018 as per the existing conditions and the related infrastructure (svr1 server) will continue to be hosted according to earlier custodial grants.

When the peg hasn't been restored within 4 months after this motion has passed OR NuLaw prohibits the NBT spending during this period, I will burn the remaining funds and with that all obligations towards the Shareholders in the custodial grant. At the same time I will formally also end the contract with the developer.
