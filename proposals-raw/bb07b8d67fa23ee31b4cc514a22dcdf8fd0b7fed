Jamie Miller (@jmiller) has Bter funds that are locked down and ineligible for immediate withdrawal, due to Bter hack and default in February 2015. The account should be handed over to @Phoenix by Bitmessage at BM-2cU99iZPcZ4AJUCzU2G797SNc9aRkLkyL9. The most recent account of the balance (which is 178.67 BTC) is here:

@TomJoad still has a variety of social media accounts, which should all be handed off to @Phoenix by Bitmessage at BM-2cU99iZPcZ4AJUCzU2G797SNc9aRkLkyL9.

All FLOT (First Liquidity Operations Team) multisig groups should immediately burn all funds, whether US-NBT or NuShares. This includes the teams holding funds at SvtGbNjWE49pTM2TiUZrYKSNkxTJx75mmC, Snvrc5q82wfe2NjEjaQAyStpPKseWrsNqn and  	BqyRzFtWXDmjxrYpyJD42MLE5xc8FrB4js.

@masterOfDisaster shall either return the 13 BTC that belong to shareholders as part of liquidity operations to the Bittrex gateway BTC address 1uBH39hNa2xahaoPisVzMnZEtAWUZod8X, or he may alternatively purchase US-NBT with the 13 BTC and then burn all the US-NBT proceeds.
