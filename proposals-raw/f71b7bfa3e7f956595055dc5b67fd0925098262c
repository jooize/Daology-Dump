As Nu's crisis going on, Jordan Lee has to put most vigour into recovering Nu's pegging, while the B&C developement has been put aside as less priority. Therefore BKS holders appoint @sigmike as the technical leader of development of B&C exchange system.

Because a portion of B&C developement fund devalues a lot due to the temperary failure of NBT peg, our develepment process may slow down especially in considerration of Sigmike's availability, BKS holders should be patient. Sigmike has proven he/she is a cryptocurrency expert after the excellent work for Peercoin, Nubits and B&C.

Other tasks such as developers payment, recruitment, marketing still belong to original responsible persons.

We still respect @JordanLee 's effort on both Nu and B&C projects, if any mistake he/she has made, is just the price on the road of innovation. And BKS holders still welcome and need Jordan's contribution to B&C project.
