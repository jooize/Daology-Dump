@Phoenix shall be paid $90 an hour for work billed for, beginning January 1, 2017. The current contractual term for @Phoenix to be Chief of Liquidity Operations currently extends until Februarry 4th. Therefore, no payments for expected duties within liquidity operations will be paid within the current contract period. While the efforts of @Phoenix will stay focused in Liquidity Operations, @Phoenix may assist in areas of endeavor helpful to NuShare holders outside the context of liquidity operations. In assisting with such efforts outside liquidity operations, @Phoenix shall receive compensation at $90/hr and may also give compensation to others, such as @Cybnate for hosting a Nu seed node. 

Compensation of others, including but not limited to liquidity operations, is at my discretion and arrangements can be made without specific shareholder involvement. This is designed to remove bureaucratic obstacles and permit nimble solution of shareholder problems. 

As usual, all transactions will be publicly transparent so shareholders will always be able to hold me accountable for my own compensation and the compensation of others.

This motion establishes @Phoenix as Chief of Liquidity Operations until such time as a shareholder motion is passed changing that or until @Phoenix resigns.
