Fellow friends of Nu,

I'm happy to announce, that Parkingyournubits.rocks has been a full success. The website had a total of 822 unique visitors since its launch on  May 1st, 2016. 
You can read all about it [here.](https://discuss.nubits.com/t/ann-parking-rates-promotional-website-parkyournubits-com/3847?u=willy)


**TL;DR**  
This contract will entitle Nu all rights to the park rates promotional page Parkingyournubits.rocks.
Further, it will allow Coinerella to deploy and run Parkingyournubits.rocks on the ALix and RAW.Coinerella high-availabiliy server structure. 

**What's Parkingyournubits.rocks?**  
Parkingyournubits.rocks is a promotional website to promote NuBits park rates. It features a FAQ section, a calculator and a tutorial how to park your NuBits.
Furthermore, we created a Twitter bot, that tweets the current highest parking rate every 24 hours. 

The website is created with HTML 5, CSS and AJAX and features responsive design. 


**What's in for Nu?**  
*Plain and simple: This website tries to gather information on NuBits parking on a single site to encourage people unfamiliar with Nu to buy NuBits and park them. *
