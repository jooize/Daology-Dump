**This proposal competes with Jordan's proposal to regain confidence in the NBT peg.**

The key difference is to first sell a more significant amount of NSR and with that strengthen the peg within a spread of 1% for 80% of the available reserves available at that time.
This plan should provide confidence to potential NSR holders that the peg will be restored and that there is a good chance we will succeed. 
This motion also maintains the current liquidity providers assuming they comply with the motion when in place. FLOT members and gateway providers who are not able or willing to comply with this motion are asked to step back when this motion passes.

**Action 1 Prepare and work on solution**
Selling NuShares will take place more aggressively. 
Doubling amount of sales from motion in one week going forward until reserves are at 15%. Then reduce to original motion until reserves hits motion thresholds and sales are no longer required.

**Action 2 Make steps to market confidence**
Obtain market confidence without taking unnecessary risks until action 1 is completed.
Until the first sale has taken place and all intended NSR have been sold, the current situation with high spreads will have to remain, although capped at maximum 5% and at least a value of 10k BTC is on order on Poloniex. Just to give the market some confidence to start with.

**Action 3 Implement**
On completion of action 1 (and 2), the reserves have been topped up with the first NSR sale as per this motion. Within 24h of ending the NSR sale FLOT will submit at least 80% of the available BTC reserves onto BTC/NBT pair on Poloniex at **1% spread** (0.5% offset on both sides) both through ALPv2 or gateways. 

It is proposed that NuLagoon should wait at least another week of NSR sales before being topped up with BTC. Upon completion of second week NSR sale it will be provided with 20% chunks of NSR sales every week until such is no longer deemed to be required or Poloniex BTC liquidity is < 10k in that week and no other reserves beyond the frozen 20% off exchange are available.

**Risks:**
1. NSR sales don't provide adequate or timely BTC liquidity and peg will fail leaving only 20% reserves
2. BTC price increases significantly offsetting NSR sales and peg will fail leaving only 20%
When this risk occurs, the remaining 20% reserves will be auctioned of to the highest bidder in a bid to orderly wind down Nu business and basically free float NBT to speculators.

**Opportunities**
1. Confidence in peg is restored and NSR will be bought building the reserves increasing confidence further
2. BTC price consolidates or decreases which will increase demand for NBT when hedgers see a solid peg defended by solid and tight walls.
