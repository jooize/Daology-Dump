In light of the recent changes in the community, it is prudent to re-evaluate the RSOT formation. This motion does not oppose the formation of RSOT, in fact it supports it. However, each signer selection needs to be revisited. Therefore, all motions naming specific RSOT signers will be rendered null and void by the passage of this motion. 

This motion encourages the passage of new RSOT signers motions after it becomes clear which signers will be loyal to the interests of shareholders.

B&C funds are currently safe and secure. They are responsive to shareholders. We need to prioritize ensuring it stays this way.
