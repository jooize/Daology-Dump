We (@Cybnate, @cryptog, @jooize, @henry) happily agree to manage development funds for Nu according to the following rules.

## Rules for DFMT's use of funds

1. The funds may only be spent on Nu related development activities.

2. To use development funds, a motion or grant should explicitly state how much funds at what time on what condition should be paid to whom, and be passed by NuShare holders.

3. A legal fund transfer is one exactly matching the terms in motions or grants described in rule #2.

4. If there is an irreconcilable dispute between DFMT members, each member of DFMT must agree to burn the funds.

5. DFMT should verify and sign the legal fund transfer with no more delay than seven days on average.

6. The payment frequency should be not more than once a fortnight on average.

7. The compensation fee is 0.08% of total funds under management with a minimum of 100 US-NBT per month for each of DFMT member.

8. A DFMT member may resign by leaving a notice 14 days ahead of leaving the team.

DFMT would like to ask for the first grant:
