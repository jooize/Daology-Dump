I propose to provide regular macosx builds of all major releases of NuBits and B&C Exchange projects for a period of 6 months for 400NBT. New macosx builds will be produced as soon as new official  build for windows and linux becomes available, not later than 2 weeks after official release.

Builds will have the following features:

* 64bit x86 architecture
* upnp support
* qt4 gui framework
* latest security updates of openssl and miniupnpc

I will also provide technical support of said macosx builds on the official forum of nubits in appropriate thread.
