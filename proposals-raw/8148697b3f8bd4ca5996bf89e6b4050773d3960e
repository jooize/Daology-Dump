Nu needs a source of revenue to continue liquidity operations. One step can be accomplished by implementing a dynamic transaction fee based upon coin age. 

We set the fee to reduce NBT by X% every year. Where X% is a variable to be determined and voted on by shareholders in a manner similar to voting on park rates. 

This would generate a yearly revenue stream for Nu which would be less than X%, but greater than 0 because the overall number of coins in circulation would decrease. 

Coins on an exchange would not face this problem. But as soon as they are withdrawn and transferred the end used would be hit with the fee. 

Positives: 
A revenue stream that Nu is currently lacking.

Cons:
This would be inflationary - NBT holders would see decreasing value in their investment
This would require a hard fork
