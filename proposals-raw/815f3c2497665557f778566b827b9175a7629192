The original NuDroid server "SVR1" still runs on a very limited infrastructure (1Gb memory, 1 CPU, 20Gb SSD) for about 10 NBT/month. It also has Cloudflare PRO level protection and SSL certificates to prevent easy hi-jacks/imposters.

Given the current memory issues it has with the Nu daemon and adding some future proofing this proposal upgrades the dedicated server to  2Gb, 2 CPU and a 30Gb SSD. This will cost 20 NBT/month.

The proposed grant is for 12 months and is broken down into the following components:
- Server 2Gb, 2CPU 20 NBT x 12 months = 240 NBT
- Cloudflare PRO 12,50 NBT/month x 12 = 150 NBT (this shares a subscription with LiquidBits)
- Operator fee 30 NBT x 12 months = 360 NBT (covering updates/backups/monitoring/certificates etc.)

Total: 240+150+360 = 750 NBT -/- remaining grant 1/3 of NBT450 (*) =150 = 600 NBT for 12 months.
