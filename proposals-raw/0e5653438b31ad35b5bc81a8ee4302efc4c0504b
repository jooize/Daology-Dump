This grant is for use in liquidity operations and will be treated as shareholder funds. They will be used in accordance with NuLaw, which at the present time demands NSR be sold. I will see that it is sold in accordance with our internal regulations. The funds may also be used to compensate liquidity providers (such as an individual conducting an auction).

This grant is necessary and urgent because NSR FLOT is not performing its duties as defined by shareholder passed motions. I will faithfully execute the will of shareholders.
