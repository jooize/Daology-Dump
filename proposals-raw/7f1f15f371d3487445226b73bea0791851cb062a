By voting for this custodial grant, shareholders elect Phoenix Commander of Liquidity Operations for a term of 3 months, beginning the day the custodial grant is passed.

**Powers Granted as Commander of Liquidity Operations**

Phoenix will have sole discretion over the use of all shareholder funds intended for use in liquidity operations. This includes all funds held by FLOT and any other agent in control of shareholder funds authorized for use in liquidity operations. The only restriction on use of funds is that they must be used to provide liquidity, which may include providing compensation to liquidity providers, renting server space and other reasonable expenses. As detailed in the transparency section, all transactions will be reported.

Phoenix will have sole control over sales of NSR intended for use in liquidity operations. This includes all NSR held by FLOT and any other agent in control of shareholder NSR authorized for use in liquidity operations. All transactions will be reported as detailed in the transparency section. However, advance notice will generally not be given as that would put us at a disadvantage versus NSR buyers.

Phoenix will have sole control over the pegged price. It is my intention to have shareholders vote on moving the peg up because this way there are no parties with privileged information, because the entire process will be public. However, I reserve the right to make a change in the peg level at any time, without advance notice.

Phoenix will have sole control over the spread at which liquidity is offered. I intend to offer it at a 1% spread, although I reserve the right to change this at any time.

**Compensation**

My payment will be 1 million NuShares per month. The first 90 days will be paid as a part of this custodial grant for 3 million NuShares. 

**Transparency**

Money flows in our decentralized liquidity operations were already as transparent as practical (we couldn't report much on independent liquidity providers using pools as they wish, for instance). Transparency will be even easier with the command model we are moving to for liquidity operations. All liquidity operators using shareholder funds are required to reveal all addresses used to handle shareholder funds and reveal complete deposit and transaction histories for all exchange accounts used to handle shareholder funds. These complete and detailed records will be made publicly available for anyone to analyze, aggregate or summarize. Shareholders are advised to hire an accountant to analyze the raw data we provide to derive the financial reporting they desire. Liquidity providers (including Phoenix) will only be expected to reveal complete raw data.

**Suspension**

Shareholders can suspend Phoenix as Commander of Liquidity Operations at any time by motion. In that cases, excess compensation not earned will be burned.
