Fellow friends of Nu,

this proposal regards a software we call ParkingLot, a tool to monitor parking and unparking transactions. 

**TL;DR**  
This contract will fund the development of a new product called ParkingLot.
Further, it will allow Coinerella to deploy  ParkingLot on the ALix and RAW.Coinerella high-availabiliy server structure. 

**What's ParkingLot?**  
We developed a blockchain parsing software that goes through every single block, looking for parking and unparking transactions. 
By using the information gathered, we can provide Nu with a **full history** of all parking transactions, as well as with an overview of all **currently parked** transactions with a next to exact prediction for their unpark transaction.  
With ParkingLot shareholders can predict the upcoming cost of unpark transactions and thus further refine their liquidity operations.

The website will be part of the Parkingyournubits.rocks domain and will feature the following things:

-Frontend using HTML 5, CSS, JS AJAX  
-Backend using PHP and CouchDB   
-Full parking transaction history (park transaction and unpark transaction) with pagination   
-Overview of currently parked NuBits with unpark prediction  
-Overview of orphaned parking transactions (yes, some park transactions have never been redeemed)   
-Statistics part including:  
	-Current amount parked / Upcoming payouts  
	-Total amount parked / payed out  
	-historic chart for all currently parked NuBits   
-all relevant data will be publicly available through *JSON API* 

**What's in for Nu?**  
*Plain and simple: Those metrics will help Nu to closely monitor and thus improve its business. *

###### Cost report:
1. ParkingLot software license v 1.0: **7000 NBT** 

Software costs: 7000 NBT  

Running costs: none, hosting is paid for with the ALix & RAW.Coinerella grant 

Total sum: **7000 NBT**

We would like to take a new approach here and split the grant between the two of us. 

TheCrema's share: 3500 NBT - Grant address: **BPnMrBUCDQpn1VYy68r8WHKwGtQqLnmmV8**  
willy's share: 3500 NBT - Grant address: **BCGbgofctMQxNCzYEKuTFmzP6GkSNA8LyV**

Please note that this contract is only valid, once both grants have passed. 

###### Notes:

- item 1 - This software will be open source. 
- item 1 - ParkingLot will not be delivered later than August 31st, 2016. Expect it to be finished much earlier. 
- item 1 - This software will be hosted on the ALix and RAW.Coinerella high-availability server structure. 

###### Terms:

§ 1 - Any future updates for ParkingLot require additional funding.    

§ 2 - Nu will only need to pay for the software licenses once, as any funded software upgrade will create a new version number with a new license.   
	
§ 3 -  Coinerella is permitted and obliged to provide the afore mentioned software on the ALix and RAW.Coinerella high-availability structure. 
	
§ 4   
(1) The start of the operation will be seamless after this grant passed. It will be announced in a separate thread.   
(2) The source code for all items (see above) will be published on Github the same day the announcement thread is created. The software will be published under the Apache License.  

§ 5 - Nu is permitted to revoke this contract, in case Coinerella becomes unresponsive to requests made through https://www.coinerella.com/index.php/Contact for more than 30 consecutive days.

§ 6 - Coinerella will provide said services in all conscience.  Apache License (see https://github.com/bananenwilly/alix/blob/master/LICENSE) applies. Warranty and liability of any nature are excluded. 

§ 7 - ParkingLot will be provided commercial-free. 

###### FAQs:

Q: What happens after the six month term for the ALix and RAW.Coinerella  high-availability server structure ends?  
A: A new proposal will be needed to continue those operations.

Q: Will Nu have to pay for the same software licenses twice?  
A: No. Any funded software update will induce a version change with a new license, which will be valid until the next funded software update is published.
