This motion amends motion [a9346a00acd50d26d174c3d2f6c0ee69c9466c49](http://https://daology.org/u/cybnate/proposals/efb13a1053b26c5770eac5b8ca6c5b994619069e)

The 1.4% fixed spread of the passive dual-side Pybot referred to in above motion and currently operational, will be changed into 1% by default when this motion passes.
Then FLOT members will also be able to suggest changes to the spread making the best use of this facility given the liquidity situation. For changes at least 2 other FLOT members will have to endorse publicly in the forum a spread change suggested by a FLOT member. The operator will respond as quickly as possible but at least within 48 hours.
