Fund development of NuBox, a Peerbox fork (peerbox.me) with Peerbox functionality extended to cover all Nu specifics like motion voting and data feeds.

When motion passes, I will start working on this and within 4 weeks I will deliver:

* Standards compliant, GPG signed Debian repository for NuBox (arm and x86_64)
* Signed Nu wallet binaries with accompanying tools
* Port of **peerbox** command with extended, Nu specific commands
* Documentation on how to install and use NuBox
* Any feature that users need but I have possibly omitted in this post with condition that it is communicated in first two weeks since motion passes and is not excessive/unrealistic
* Source code for the full product.
* Nu version updates for a period of 1 year, as long as they are compatible with existing codebase and don't require major architectural overhauls.
* After this period new motion will be started to extend maintenance period.
* Nu will pay me 4000 NBT upfront for this project.

I will not be dealing with marketing, logo design and website. I propose that the same designer of all other Nu logos design this one too and that projects website is integrated into the rest of the project properly.
