It's important for Nu to dispel the rumors that the shareholder base is centralized because of the early distribution method. The only method we have is to issue new NuShares to parties not currently associated with the network. By increasing the supply 50% of the current total we can assure that no entity from the beginning stages of the network has enough power to control the voting mechanisms and assure decentralized ownership. These parties should be chosen strategically as they will become new partners in the Nu network. These parties should be familiar with the global impact of the network, and have a strong understanding of economics.

In the interest of reaching the goals of this motion and fitting within the parameters then passing of this motion would split 	409,480,700 NSR between the 12 district banks of the United States Federal Reserve. Each bank would receive 34,123,391 NSR and become invested in the growth of Nu going forward. Explicitly these are:

* Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta
* Federal Reserve Bank of Boston
* Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago
* Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland
* Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas
* Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City
* Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis
* Federal Reserve Bank of New York
* Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia
* Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond
* Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco
* Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis

By reaching this agreement between shareholders to supply the United States Federal Reserve district banks with partial ownership in the Nu network we'll further decentralize ownership while partnering with an organization that has a strong economic focus.
