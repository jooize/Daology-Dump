###Intro  
The BTF - ***B***locks & Chains Exchange ***T***ask ***F***orce unites a group of people who stand ready to fulfill custodian roles.  
The standard role will be a part of a multisig group. In special circumstances singlesig custodianship might be appropriate.  

###Application  
@masterOfDisaster - below called "BTF member" - shall be one of the members of the ***B***locks & Chains Exchange ***T***ask ***F***orce .  
The BTF member will coordinate with other members of BTF to the benefit of Blocks & Chains Exchange.  
The BTF member promises to be a part of BTF for up to one year and to abide by all shareholder motions governing the use of funds.  
The BTF member will be able to respond to any request for signing within 60 hours of its proposal; shareholders must be promptly informed of exceptions.   

###Compensation
The contract will have a 90-day period, automatically being renewed unless terminated by shareholder motion or retirement of the BTF member.  
In case of retirement the BTF member will support transfer of the funds in BTF custody to a replacement member or a new multisig address, respectively, if demanded.
By the end of each cycle, a total of amount of 450 NBT shall be paid to the BTF member, conditional on satisfactory performance, which shall be measured in terms of his presence, effort and contribution. The BTF member reserves the right to withdraw from his service if he does not receive the full amount of compensation by the end of any cycle or by personal discretion.

###Rationale for the compensation  
Compared to the Nu FLOT member compensation this motion offers a slightly increased fee, although the response time is increased.  
BTF members are expected to have an increased need to discuss compared to Nu FLOT, because there's no framework available yet to guide their actions.
