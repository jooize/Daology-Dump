All B&C shareholders funds in existence as of August 21st, 2016 shall be transferred to @Phoenix immediately upon passage of this motion, to be used in the interest of shareholders. This includes funds held by Jordan Lee and Angela. It excludes any funds that may be given by shareholders as a BlockShare or BlockCredit custodial grant.

I will commit to presenting monthly reports of total funds remaining and spending reports by category, with compensation and expenses as the categories. I will charge a 3% handling fee for all funds disbursed as compensation or expenses. I won't reveal addresses because our contractors want some privacy about what they are being paid. It is easy to be critical of this small bubble of privacy in our otherwise incredibly transparent solution, but critics need to understand that making exact compensation arrangements public is undesirable to many contractors and such a policy would make it more difficult to secure the professional help we need.
