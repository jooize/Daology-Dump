a) continue maintaining and improving the buyback and reserve operation calculator for 3 months, starting on Apri 19, 2016, when the proposal was approved. 

b) perform the weekend calculation run and post the result free of charge.

c) do mhps' best to inform the shareholders if mhps' service is unavailable 48 hours in advance.
