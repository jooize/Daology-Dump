MuchoGusto will be required to maintain liquidity in his established liquidity provider profitability experiment at a 0.6% spread, instead of the 1% spread that was previously established. Otherwise the operation will continue as it has been.The experiment will continue along with the reporting that has been established. 

Shareholders will guarantee a minimum profit of 3% per month, compounded monthly. The calculation used to determine profit would be the Bitcoin Price Adjusted With Pool Payments NAV, which I have been reporting regularly. Shareholder payments will be capped at 3% of the NAV for each month. By way of example, after two months, the guaranteed total return would be 6.09%, and 9.27% after three months. After more than a month of the experiment the actual rate of return has been 1.86%. If it were still 1.86% at the end of the first 2 months, then either FLOT or shareholders must pay MuchoGusto enough to make a 6.09% profit, subject to the 3% monthly cap. Payments will be monthly. I will request payment from FLOT. If they do not provide it, shareholders are bound to pay using a custodial grant. Notice that in all cases payment will be made after services are given.

MuchoGusto assumes all exchange default risk. If for some reason it became impossible to withdraw funds from Poloniex MuchoGusto will suffer the loss without assistance from shareholders. Shareholders must compensate trading losses if any exist.

Compensation from NuPool and shareholders will be added to funds used to provide liquidity to allow compounding returns.

This will be guaranteed liquidity, meaning I will not remove the funds from the Poloniex order books for any reason, including a liquidity crisis. Not removing funds shouldn't be confused with uninterrupted service. There have been two service interruptions due to unexpected server problems and one due to a NuBot failure already. I'm promising a 95% service level.
