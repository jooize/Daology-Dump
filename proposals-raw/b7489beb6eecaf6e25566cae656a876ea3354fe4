* JordanLeePhoenix is always right.
* Real accounting doesn't need addresses and volumes per transaction - it's all transparently written in the blockchain, even if central exchanges are used.
* Nulagoon is in no way associated with JordanLeePhoenix.
* Augeas is the bad guy. It's not a farce in which JordanLeePhoenix scams shareholders and customers.
* Convert vital reserves to a form that collapses in value during rough times when needed most through a share buyback program.
* Any forum account that posts in the exact same way as Jordan is not actually Jordan.
* Large performance bonuses are healthy for a DAC, especially when they give majority control to the Chief! He won't let us down! No way, no how!
