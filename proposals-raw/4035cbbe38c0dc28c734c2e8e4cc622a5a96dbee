The script underlying the output that is the focus of this thread:
https://discuss.nubits.com/t/nsr-buyback-calculations/3347

shall be changed to reserve 100% of outstanding NuBits instead of the current figure of 15%.

A minimum of 0.5% of the total NuShare supply must be sold each week while so long as either one of these two conditions exist:
1) There is not a buy wall equal to or greater than $0.98
2) The 100% reserve requirement is not met.

This minimum applies to the aggregate NSR sales by all custodians. Stating the weekly NuShare sales requirement as a minimum permits the negotiation of a sale of a large block of NSR to a single buyer, which would be tremendously helpful in meeting our primary objective: restoration and maintenance of the $1.00 peg.
