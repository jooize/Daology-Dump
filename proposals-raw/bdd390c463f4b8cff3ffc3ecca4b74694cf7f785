Hi Shareholders.

Despite saying that the new version of the ALP  software would be ready for the next operation of NuPool, it now looks like that won't be the case. As such, I would like to extend the current operation of NuPool for another 30 days. 
The parameters will remain the same as the current operation.

The work on the new version of the software is going well. You can keep tabs on the state in the chat room here https://gitter.im/inuitwallet/ALP-Server and on the github repo here https://github.com/inuitwallet/ALP-Server.

We currently have funds for another 9 days (approx) of operation. If this proposal doesn't pass within that time, I am willing to fund the pool myself for a few extra days.  

The proposal:

NuPool will operate on Poloniex and Bittrex for a 30 day period. The total target of the operation will be 50,000 NBT split 4:1 between the two supported exchanges in favour of Poloniex. This gives a target of 40,000 NBT split equally between bid and ask on Poloniex and a target of 10,000 NBT split equally between bid and ask on Bittrex.

The pool reward will be lowered to 0.24% per day which translates to 7.2% for the duration of the operation.

The figures are:

Duration: 30 Days
Daily Rate: 0.24%
Total Rate: 7.2%

Poloniex: 40,000 NBT > 20,000 BID | 20,000 ASK
Bittrex: 10,000 NBT > 5,000 BID | 5,000 ASK

Server Tolerance: 0.0105 or 1.05%
Spread After Fees:
Poloniex (fee = 0.2%) - 1.1% SAF
Bittrex (fee = 0.25%) - 1% SAF

Grant Amount: 50,000 x 7.2% = 3600 NBT
Pool Fee: 50,000 x 1% = 500 NBT


Total Grant Requested: 4100 NBT
