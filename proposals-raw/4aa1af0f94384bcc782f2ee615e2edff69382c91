At the time of this writing the Standard and Core calculations that require a certain quantity of NuShares to be bought or sold each week is NuLaw. It was designed to coordinate the activities of many decentralized liquidity providers, so in that context it needed to be a mandate.

However, with liquidity operations now operating in a hierarchical fashion with expert guidance, it is appropriate to designate the Standard and Core calculation as a guideline that the can be overridden by the Chief of Liquidity Operations.

With the passage of this motion, the established NSR sale and buyback calculations will become a guidline that can be overridden by the Chief of Liquidity Operations.
