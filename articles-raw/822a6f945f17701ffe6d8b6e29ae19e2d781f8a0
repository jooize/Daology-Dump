The DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), called Nu is in practice a decentralized central bank that issues or burns NuBits (NBT), a crypto-token pegged to the US dollar.

1NBT = 1USD. 

Shareholders of Nu, called NuShareholders, vote for monetary policies that are recorded in the Nu's blockchain in a trust-less and decentralized fashion.

NuShareholders hold shares of the network, called NuShares that are needed for voting.


Some materials if you are interested:

1- You have the official home page of NuBits: - nubits.com 

2- You have the documentation:  - https://docs.nubits.com - that gives you all the information needed for integrating NuBits.

3- You have the forum - https://discuss.nubits.com/ - where all is discussed and voted.

4- You have the history of Nu- https://docs.nubits.com/history/ - although partial at this point. However, it would give you a sense of what Nu can achieve rapidly.

Some additional information:

- NuBits recently became the first decentralized digital currency in history to maintain $1.00 for an entire year:

Value stability is highly desirable in a currency, and we expect more and more users will begin using NuBits for online purchases.

At the same time, we expect more and more startups to use NuBits for financial services, such as remittance.

- NuBits is routinely in the top 10 of trading volume, and has occasionally risen into the top 3 on coinmarketcap.com .

- More products such as a Yuan-pegged, a Euro-pegged, and a SDR-pegged NuBits are in the works:

There are so many things happening (decentralized liquidity pools, parametric order book...) that I cannot mention everything here.

Nu is a very agile network that can evolve very quickly.

Right now the demand is growing.

I hope you could find a way to make use of NuBits!
